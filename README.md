# FREE Site Status Page
Are you looking for status page for your site/sites? Many times we need to check if our site is working properly or not, So I developed this tool, You can easily host it on GitHub Pages and by just making few changes you can create status page for your website & as it is hosted on GitHub pages, it is completely free to use. You can check Example here [Status Page JustInClicks.com](https://status.justinclicks.com) </br>
See [Live App Preview](https://kaustubhk24.github.io/FREE-Site-Status-Page/)

## How to Create Status Page for your site?   
* To create status Page first fork [this](https://github.com/kaustubhk24/FREE-Site-Status-Page) repository.
* Go to repository setting and turn on GitHub pages option.
* In Next Step open file named `CNAME` & remove text `status.justinclicks.com` and enter your custom URL. e.g. `status.example.com`
* From repo settings enable tick on `SSL` & update records respectively in your domain `DNS settings`.
* Last step is to open `main.js` & you will see code below, you just need to add your sites there.
```
sites=[
    {
        'site_name':'Example.com',
        'site_url':'https://www.example.com/'
    },
    
    {
        'site_name':'Sub Example',
        'site_url':'https://sub-domain.example.com/'
    }
]
```    

* Now at the place of `site_name` you have to enter your site Title & in `site_url` enter exact URL of your site with `http or https` properly.
* Make sure you haven't kept any previous site name, just remove all of them & add yours
* Now create file in `incidents/` folder with site name for example if your site name is `Example Site` in `main.js` then your file name will be `Example Site.json`, Do not remove spaces or anything , use exact site name from `main.js` & keep file in `incidents/` folder .
* To report incident open your site file from `incidents/` folder, & copy content below there
```
[
    {
        "incident_name":"incident_name at time",
        "description":"description"
    },
    {
        "incident_name":"incident_name 2 at time",
        "description":"description 2"
    }
]

```
* Make changes according to your requirements, that's it
* Done ! Once GitHub Build pages your site status page will be Live.
